# WhatsApp Chat Data Visualizer

This project transforms WhatsApp chat data into insightful visualizations. It includes features like a word cloud, a heatmap calendar showing when most messages occurred throughout the year, and a messages-per-user bar graph. I used Python libraries such as Pandas, Calmap, Matplotlib, WordCloud, and more to create these visualizations.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to analyze and visualize WhatsApp chat data to derive interesting insights. For example, identifying the most frequently used words, understanding the most active times of the year, and visualizing the message distribution among users.

## Technology Stack

- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Calmap, Matplotlib, WordCloud

## Visualizations
